# Vim Settings
This is my configuration for [Vim] as a web developer.  I'm using [Vundle] as the plug-in manager, which has a dependency on [Git] \(so be sure to have it installed\).

## Installation
1. Load [Vundle]
	``
	$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
	``

2. Run `:PluginInstall` inside [Vim] to load all the bundles

3. Profit!
